# Weight Buddy

Basic app that calculates what plates should be put on each side of the barbell for the given input. Also spits out assumptions and left over weight when exact weight cannot be achieved with available plates. Calculations all assume pound-mass(lbs) for units. Responsive for use on mobile.

Built using React/Flux.
